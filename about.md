## software engineering

I am an experienced Ruby developer who had sucessfully designed, implemented and deployed variety of Rails applications.
I developed monolith applications as well as systems utilizing SOA (service oriented architecture).

I enjoy working on complex user interfaces. JavaScript has been in my toolset from the very beginnings of my professional jurney.

I'm always trying to pick "right tool for the job". Below you can find a list of tools I like to use:
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- ElasticSearch
- Vue.js
- ZMQ
- NodeJS
- Redis
