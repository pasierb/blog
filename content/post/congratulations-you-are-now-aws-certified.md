> Hi Michal Pasierbski,

> Congratulations! You have successfully completed the requirements for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification. This certification, and all associated benefits will be valid through Dec 02, 2022.

## Motivation

When I (re)joined EF Education First 9 months ago I found myself in a company fully invested in AWS but with little expertise within development teams how to take advantage of it.

I noticed that teams are spending increasingly more time on infrastructure maintenance and on tasks that could have been automated.

I treated this as an opportunity to improve my skills, learn something new and help my colleagues.

## Preparation

I didn't have much exposure to the cloud providers before - started my career before cloud was a thing and focused on frontend when it was, unfortunate timing.

The interwebs were pretty clear about recommendations at the time:

* [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/), or
* [A Cloud guru](https://acloud.guru/)

I went with Linux academy mainly because if their hands-on labs. It's a great feature if you want to get some practice in a real environment without risking getting into costs.

Linux Academy has a course preparing specifically to "AWS Solutions Architect - associate" certificate, which is perfect if you want to get a broad view of what AWS has to offer, as well as some details on most important parts (IAM, networking, S3, EC2 and "serverless"). Completing the course took me roughly 3 months of mostly evening studying. 

After that, I was grinding [AWS Certified Solutions Architect 2019 Practice Questions: Over 800+ Practice Questions with Explanation. 100% Unconditional Pass Guarantee](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BJGXPXK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_RCSTEbZ84NZF0) to familiarize me with the format of questions, as those can be quite tricky at times with the phrasing (English is not my first language but I do consider myself as a quite fluent speaker).

## Is it worth it?
