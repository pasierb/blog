__Work__ for __25__ minutes, __rest 5__.

> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

### How?

This method is very straight forward
- work (25 minutes)
- rest (5 minutes)
  - after 4 work segments take 15 minutes break instead of 5

Segments can not be broken, split. If you started segment, you have to complete it.

### Why?

Main goal is to let yourself focus on one task - to program yourself on task if you will.
Barbara Oakley is talking about your inner zombies. When those zombies don't have clear task to perform they start wander around doing everything (nothing).

For me pomodoro is a way to not waste time on "not-my-best" days, when there is something on my mind that i can not get rid of, or i simply don't feel like working.
In such cases pomodoro is invaluable

### Tools

You can find dozens of decent pomodoro timers online.
I'm using [Goodtime][goodtime]. It has clean interface and handfull of options.
