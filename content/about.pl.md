Hello, I'm Michal.

I'm a software engineer, currently working at [EF Education First](https://www.ef.com) in Zurich, Switzerland. I have more than 10 years of experience in both backend and frontend development (details can be found in my [CV](/cv/)).
Lately I'm enjoying making web development simpler, more maintainable and automated as much as possible.

Privately I'm a dad, husband and dog owner. I like playing computer games, learning new technologies and hacking around hobby projects.
