Today I got an email with the same title as this post. Let me explain **why** I took the exa, **how** does it work and **what** can you expect from it.

<!-- more -->

### Why?

Couple months ago friend of mine had an interview for a fron end role. In a course of the discussion interviewer asked if he has it and recommended it. Normally I don't pay attention to "papers", but since:

a) it came from an iterviewer

b) it's Google

c) I was sick, laying in bed bored as hell...

I compulsively bought a pass (it costs 99$).

### What (can you expect)?

Certifaction itself covers quite a lot of ground:

- Basic Website Layout and Styling
- Front End Networking
- Accessibility
- Progressive Web Apps
- Performance Optimization and Caching
- Testing and Debugging
- ES2015 Concepts and Syntax
- Mobile Web Forms

You have 4 hours to complete set if hands-on tasks. No theory, just practice.

I was kind of surprised how each of those mini assignemnts were grounded in real world use cases. "Terms and conditions" are preventing me to disclouse details but if you go through [official study guide](https://developers.google.com/training/certification/mobile-web-specialist/StudyGuide_MobileWebSpecialist.pdf) nothing will catch you off guard.

### How (does it work)?

You are given 4 hours to complete whole thing. Sounds like a lot, but in fact I bearly managed to finish in time.

One reason is that there a quite a few excersises and just a fact that you have to switch between them (phisically and mentaly) takes some time of the clock.

Other reason is that you are working inside VM, via browser, in not you editor of choice (unles you are Atom user), without your normal setup, etc. I don't even know how many times I tried to close a browser tab inside the VM (ctrl + w) and accidently closed tab that was running exam on my host browser...
