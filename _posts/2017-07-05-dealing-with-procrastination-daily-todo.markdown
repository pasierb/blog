TL;DR __write a list of tasks to complete for the next day__.

> Procrastination (from latin's "procrastinare", that translates in to : the prefix pro-, 'forward', and suffix -crastinus, 'till next day' from cras, 'tomorrow' ) is the avoidance of doing a task that needs to be accomplished.Sometimes, procrastination takes place until the "last minute" before a deadline. Procrastination can take hold on any aspect of lifeâ€”putting off cleaning the stove, repairing a leaky roof, seeing a doctor or dentist, submitting a job report or academic assignment or broaching a stressful issue with a partner. Procrastination can lead to feelings of guilt, inadequacy, depression and self-doubt.

Writing a TODO list for the next day is one of best ways to deal with procrastination.
Apart of giving you clear tasks to focus on, it deals with __"quilt"__ problem giving sense of __accomplishment__ of the day plan.

Additionally, if you compose this TODO __before going to bed__ your brain will subconsciously start processing those tasks.
Who knows, maybe you will wake up with one of those "Eureka!" moments ;)

### Couple of key points:
- divide long, complicated probles into __small, managable tasks__
- put them in order: __most difficult -> least difficult__. It's easier to handle hard problems in the morning when distractions have not piled up yet.
- __keep the list short__, going home with unfinished list may cause feeling of guilt instead of eliminating it
